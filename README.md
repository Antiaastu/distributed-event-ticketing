# Distributed Event Ticketing System

A robust, microservices-based event ticketing platform designed to handle high-concurrency ticket bookings. This project demonstrates a modern distributed architecture using Go for backend services and Next.js for a responsive frontend interface.

##  Project Overview

The Distributed Event Ticketing System allows users to browse events, select specific seats (including VIP/VVIP classes), and book tickets in real-time. It features a secure authentication system, an admin dashboard for event management, and a resilient booking flow that handles concurrency using locking mechanisms.

### Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled services for scalability and maintainability.
- **Real-time Seat Booking**: Interactive seat selection with concurrency handling.
- **User & Admin Roles**: distinct dashboards and capabilities for admins and regular users.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with auto-logout and state persistence.
- **Resilient State Management**: Persists booking flows across page refreshes.
- **Automated Notifications**: Email notifications for booking confirmations (simulated).

##  Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Framework**: Gin Web Framework
- **Gateway**: Nginx (Reverse Proxy & Rate Limiting)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (Primary), Redis (Caching & Locking)
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ (Async communication)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Load Testing**: k6

### Monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus
- **Visualization**: Grafana

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Library**: React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **UI Components**: Radix UI / Shadcn
- **State Management**: React Context API + LocalStorage

##  Monitoring & Observability

The system includes a comprehensive monitoring stack to track service health and performance.

- **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from all microservices at /metrics. It collects data such as:
  - http_requests_total: Total number of HTTP requests by method, handler, and status code.
  - http_request_duration_seconds: Histogram of request latencies.
  - Go runtime metrics (memory usage, goroutines, etc.).

- **Grafana**: Visualizes the metrics collected by Prometheus. It provides dashboards to monitor:
  - Request rates and error rates per service.
  - Latency distributions.
  - System resource usage.

### Accessing Dashboards
- **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) (Default login: dmin / dmin)

##  Security & Performance

- **Rate Limiting**: The API Gateway (Nginx) is configured with a rate limit of **10 requests/second** per IP (with a burst allowance of 20) to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
- **High Capacity**: Stress testing with **k6** demonstrated the system can handle **100+ concurrent users** with sub-3ms latency and zero failures.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (for running backend services and databases)
- **Node.js** (v22+ recommended)
- **Go** (v1.24+ if running services locally without Docker)

### 1. Start the Backend
The backend relies on several infrastructure components (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ). The easiest way to run it is via Docker Compose.

`ash
cd backend
# Create a .env file if not present (see backend/README.md)
docker-compose up --build
# To run and start all the services in the background
docker compose up -d
`

### 2. Start the Frontend
Once the backend services are running:

`ash
cd frontend
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the development server
npm run dev
`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
